# Decisions – BabaCut

Newest first. Entries before 2026-11-08 are reconstructed from HANDOVER.md, README and commit history.

## 2026-11-10 – 1.1.4 closed-test update planned (task d444acae)
- Proposal only, no code ("erst reden, dann bauen"): `docs/CLOSED_TEST_1_1_4_PLAN.md` (German, for the owner).
- Recommended scope: A localise German error-toast labels (~10 new strings × 7 languages), B versionName 1.1.4 +
  Play release notes in 7 languages, D English crash-report labels (optional). Deferred: C (TimelineRemap caption
  300 ms clamp quirk; needs the tests of open PR b9d022fb and its own phone test), caption drift, RTL layout.
- Honest timing: the day-7–10 window of the second test period (~1–5 Nov) has passed; 1.1.4 still strengthens the
  re-application answer and the next test period if Google rejects again.
- versionCode: open PR b9d022fb already sets 82; 1.1.4 takes 83 if that PR is merged first, otherwise 82.
- Unused German name lists (`CaptionStyle.TEMPLATE_NAMES`, `Mosaic.LAYOUT_NAMES`, `ColorFilters.NAMES`) are not
  shown in the UI and are left alone.

## 2026-11-09 – Deep-integration inventory (task 9299e3fd)
- Docs-only inventory; no code changed. Result: `docs/AI_NATION.md` "State and backlog (2026-11-09)".
- Backlog order (proposed via `hub_propose_tasks`, owner releases): PR CI first (no tests, no PR checks today),
  then first unit tests, no release for docs-only pushes, self-hosted font, Play re-application draft, 1.1.4 plan,
  `MainActivity.kt` split proposal.
- PR #1 left untouched although it is superseded by the merged PR #2; closing it is the owner's call.

## 2026-11-08 – Owner profile harvested (task 9b8fbac3)
- 19 owner insights (3 `_cross`, 16 project) distilled from HANDOVER, README and commits; submitted to the hub and
  recorded in `docs/FINETUNING.md`. The file is excluded from the public site via `docs/_config.yml`.
- This branch is stacked on PR #1 (onboarding) because the record files only exist there; merge PR #1 first.

## 2026-11-08 – Onboarding into AI Nation
- Agents work on `agent/…` branches with pull requests; no direct pushes to `main`, no self-merge.
  Previously Claude pushed straight to `main` (HANDOVER §2). Note: every push to `main` creates a public GitHub
  release with an APK, so merges should be deliberate.
- Project record: existing root `HANDOVER.md` stays (not renamed); new record files live in `docs/` and are
  excluded from the GitHub Pages site via `docs/_config.yml`.
- **Pending: `project.team`.** The request could not be filed: `hub_request_decision` returned 403 (forbidden)
  for role `video-editor-entwickler`. Prepared draft (to be filed by a role with permission; owner text in German):
  1. Schlank – Entwickler + Code-Reviewer – kits: core, qa (lowest cost; tests/stability only).
  2. Launch-Team – kits: core, qa, copy, security, growth (Play approval, imprint/privacy, store copy, tests + PR CI).
  3. Voll – kits: core, ui, qa, assets, copy, security, growth, sales (fastest growth, highest cost before launch).
  Recommendation: option 2 – no subscription revenue without Play production access; it lowers legal risk
  (imprint, Google Fonts) and prepares Pro conversion at moderate cost. Predicted owner choice: option 2.
  If no decision: option 1.
